# Forecast Planner Client


## Flatiron School project produced by Laura Archambault and Ariel Davis

The purpose of the Forecast Planner application is to provide users with the tools to plan events and be provided with special notices depending on the weather for that day. Using the WeatherIO API, based off of the information that the user gives, an event is created and these notices are shown on your listing of events.
